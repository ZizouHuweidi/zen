# zen

my personal OS image focused on a clean and minimal dev and general use setup. built using blue-build (bootc)

## Installation

> [!WARNING]  
> [This is an experimental feature](https://www.fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/OstreeNativeContainerStable), try at your own discretion.

To rebase an existing atomic Fedora installation to the latest build:

- First rebase to the unsigned image, to get the proper signing keys and policies installed:

  ```
  rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/zizouhuweidi/zen:latest
  ```

- Reboot to complete the rebase:

  ```
  systemctl reboot
  ```

- Then rebase to the signed image, like so:

  ```
  rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/zizouhuweidi/zen:latest
  ```

- Reboot again to complete the installation

  ```
  systemctl reboot
  ```

The `latest` tag will automatically point to the latest build. That build will still always use the Fedora version specified in `recipe.yml`, so you won't get accidentally updated to the next major version.
